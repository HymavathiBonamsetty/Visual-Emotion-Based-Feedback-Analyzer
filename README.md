# Visual-Emotion-Based-Feedback-Analyzer

In today's digital age, feedback analysis plays a crucial role in understanding customer sentiments and improving products and services. However, traditional text-based feedback analysis often falls short in capturing the full spectrum of emotions expressed by users. To address this problem, we propose an innovative approach: Enhanced Feedback Analysis through Visual Emotion Tracking using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The problem we aim to tackle is the limited expressiveness of text-based feedback analysis. Traditional methods primarily rely on textual data, which can miss the nuanced emotions and sentiments that users convey through non-verbal cues, such as images, videos, or emojis. This limitation hampers our ability to fully understand customer feedback and make informed business decisions. In summary, our Enhanced Feedback Analysis through Visual Emotion Tracking using CNN algorithm addresses the limitations of traditional text-based feedback analysis, opening up new possibilities for understanding and responding to user emotions and sentiments across various domains.
